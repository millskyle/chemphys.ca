## To update Publications or People

2. Commit your changes to the `test` branch.
3. Check https://chemphys.ca/publications-test and/or https://chemphys.ca/people-test to very your change took effect and did not break anything.
4. Create a new pull request into Master, noting that you confirm your change did not break the website.
5. An admin must approve the pull request. Once this happens, the change will take affect.  The `master` version is cached, and changes could take a bit after they are merged into `master`.



# Publications

In `publications.js`, a publications entry looks like

```python
            {
                authors: ["First Last", "First Last"],
                title: "Title strings",
                date: "YYYY-MM-DD",
                journal: "Phys. Rev. A 96, 042113",
                DOI: "10.1103/PhysRevA.96.042113",
                arxiv: "1710.08053",
                pdf: "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.08053.pdf",
                abstract: "Optional, unused as of now",
            },
```

- `authors`: List of authors in the order they appear on the publication.
- `title`: The title of the publication
- `date`: string representation of publication date. Only year is displayed. Month and day are used for sorting.
- `journal`: OPTIONAL. Journal reference
- `DOI`: OPTIONAL. The Digital Object Identifier, without the "https://doi.org/"
- `arxiv`: OPTIONAL. The arXiv.org identifier.
- `pdf`: OPTIONAL. The link to a PDF version of the publication.  If `arxiv` is specified, `pdf` will be populated automatically. If both are specified, the `pdf` specified explicitly will take precedent.- `abstract`: UNUSED. A field for the publication abstract, but is currently unused.





# People

In `people.js`, a people entry looks like

```python
            {
                name: "First Last",
                photo: "https://chemphys.ca/pages/people_photos/cat14.jpeg",
                email: "email@email.com",
                status: "Summer Student, 2017",
                website: "http://example.com",
                affiliations: ["Affiliation 1", "Affiliation 2"],
                order: 700,
                former: true,
            },
```


- `name` : Name of the person.  Entries are sorted by the letters after the first space.
- `photo`: An image to use. If the image is not square, the right-most pixels will be cropped. The image must be at least 150x150 pixels.  256x256 is recommended.
- `email`: OPTIONAL. Email address.
- `status`: OPTIONAL.  Position/role in the group
- `website`: OPTIONAL. A üåê icon will link to this website.
- `affiliations`: OPTIONAL. A list of institutional affiliations. 
- `order`: Order parameter used for grouping (e.g. RO=100, PhD student=500, etc.) 
- `former`: OPTIONAL. If true, person will be placed in the Alumni section. Omit or false for current members.


Notes: People are sorted first by `order`, then by last name.  Photos must be hosted from the chemphys.ca domain.  Externally linked photos will break the website.
